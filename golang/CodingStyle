sora-test coding style
======================

This is a short document describing the preferred coding style for the
fukurogi. Coding style is ver personal, and I won't *force* my views on
anybody, but this is what goes for anything that I have to be able to
maintain, and I'd prefer it for most other things too. Please at least
consider the points made here.

Breaking long lines and strings
================================

Coding style is all readability and maintainability using commonly
available tools.

The limit on the length of lines is 80 columns and this is a strongly
preferred limit.

Statements longer thatn 80 columns will be broken into sensible chunks, unless
exceeding 80 columns significantly increases readability and does not hide
information. Descendants are always substantially shorter than the parent and
are placed substantially to the right. The same applies to function headers
with a long argument list. However, never break use-visible strings such as
printk messages, because that breaks the ability to grep for them.
